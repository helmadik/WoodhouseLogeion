# WoodhouseLogeion
Woodhouse English-Greek as used at Logeion
While inherited from a csv style file, I have to warn that this is _not_ currently csv, due to an old editor adding extra newlines. Otherwise, some of the standard markup for use in Logeion has been added: author, title, and the like. A handful of diacritics corrections.
